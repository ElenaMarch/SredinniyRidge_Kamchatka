## SredinniyRidge_Kamchatka
# Volcanoes in Cryosphere, Kuril-Kamchatka arc

The web map over Kuril-Kamchatka glaciation and volcanoes is build in the Laboratory of Informatic Technologies and Geoecology of the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. 

It is aimed to be a complex multi-scaled GIS putting together available data on volcanic activity and glacialtion of the region. The map is a "work in progress" product. 

# Layers
By now the map's layers include:

- Active volcanoes and volcanic hazard zones for Kamchatka and Kurils
- Sredinniy ridge: quaternary and holocene volcanoes, holocene lava flows
- Kluchevskoy volcano: cinder cones and lava flows
- Tolbachik volcano: cinder cones and lava flows
- Glaciers and moraine - Sredinniy ridge, Northern group of volcanoes
- Geological Samples
- Maximum accumulation of seasonal snow (snow water equivalent)
- Background - Topographic map/Sattelite Imagery

Attributions information of the map layers is available via popups. Scientific references are available under the tab "References" of the map's sidebar.

The map functionality allows:
- Interactive sidebar with tabs
 - Switching layers visibility
 - Interactive legend which content is synchronized with the layers in the active map view
 - Measuring distances
 - Drawing objects - points/lines/polygons and downloading them as json file
 - Uploading GPS points or other data to the map in form of KMZ, GPX and JSON files.
 - Geological samples: 
    - Customizing appearence of markers
    - Data review of chemical analysis - major elements, trace elements, ratios of trace elements, isotopes 
    - Interactive scatter plots for chemical elements/ratios of chemical elements. Geographical queries of data on chart.

The webb-map is built using the awesome open-source JS library Leaflet. 
Besides, it makes use of a set of Leaflet plugins (incl. ESRI for Leaflet) and ArcGIS basemaps - Topographic and Firefly Imagery. The basemaps are freely distributed for non-commercial use under Essentials Developer Plan (ESRIâ€™s Terms of Use).
